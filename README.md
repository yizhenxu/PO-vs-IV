1. run WeightsCal_11cutpoints20251026_Truncate.R to generate the weights with the truncation thresholds (cc being 0.1, 0.05, 0.01)
2. run Main_11cutpoints20251026_Truncate.R to obtain Table 3's under different truncation thresholds
3. run Main_11cutpoints20251130_Truncate_Weights.R to generate the visualization of weights (barplots and cumulative weights) that were included in the appendix
